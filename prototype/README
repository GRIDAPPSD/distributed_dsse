The Multi-Area State Estimation (MASE) prototype includes the following files
and directories:

wls_estimate.jl: starting point for prototype taken form the JuMP WLS state
                 estimation formulation in the benchmark/wls/julia directory
                 of this repository

test_13assets_lf: directory containing IEEE 13 node circuit assets test case
                  formulated for load flow problems used for wls_estimate.jl

mase_proto.jl: first version that does per zone estimates with some improperly
               conceived data exchange between first and second estimates

mase_proto_S.jl: better data exchange by computing the S vector after the
                 first estimates inorder to update the zvec measurement values
                 before the second estimates

mase_proto_SM.jl: adds new measurements to each shared node per zone so there
                  is a vi, Pi, and Qi measurement for all of them and then
                  includes these measurements in the data exchange between
                  the first and second estimates

mase_files_pu: directory containing per-unit input files for the published test
               case for all mase_proto*.jl versions

To run a prototype version, start the julia environment from a terminal shell.
From the julia command prompt, enter, for example:

include("mase_proto_SM.jl")

This will run the prototype code, caching it and modules referenced in memory
for much faster execution if the code is re-run by running the include command
again.
